# gatsby-source-strapi

This is a fork of [gatsby-source-strapi](https://github.com/strapi/gatsby-source-strapi) with a fix by ungagigd to add support for images embedded in markdown content. I also made some changes on top of ungagigd's changes to fix some bugs against the latest version of gatsby and make it usable easily for me. 

To use, just add this as a submodule of your gatsby site in the plugins directory or clone the repo into your plugins directory.
